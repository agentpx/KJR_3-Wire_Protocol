 **KJR 3-Wire-Protocol**
 
 **The Techinical aspect behind the inner working of the 3-wire-protocol and why it works well!**
 - It uses electrical energy pulses (pulse of certain duration)
 - Electrical energy travels at a constant speed no matter the medium (wire) resistance
 - Eliminated the distance limitations of other wire communication protocols (i.e. I2C, RS-232 (Serial), Parallel Comm. & etc.)
 - The protocol is similar to morse code this protocol depends on the duration of the beeps
 
 **Advantages**
 -
 
 electricity travels at a constants speed regardless of the resistance of wire
 
 method of transmission is based on electrical energylapse or the duration of transmission
