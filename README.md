 **KJR 3-Wire-Protocol**
 
 **The Techinical aspect behind the inner working of the kjr-3-wire-protocol and why it works well!**
 - It uses electrical energy pulses (pulse of certain duration)
 - Electrical energy travels at a constant speed no matter the medium (wire) resistance
 - This protocol is similar to morse code, it depends on the duration of the beeps
 
 **Advantages**
 - Eliminated the distance limitations of common wire communication protocols (i.e. I2C, RS-232 (Serial), Parallel, & etc.)
 - 

 
 **Disadvantages**
 - Slow transfer as this method of detection depends on the delay of the pulses
 - voltage drop along the wires is directly proportional to the distance however if you can keep and maintain the voltage at the recieving end at a allowable detection threshold this protocol can still work (100meters, 300 meters?)
 
 
 electricity travels at a constants speed regardless of the resistance of wire
 
 method of transmission is based on electrical energylapse or the duration of transmission
