 KJR 3 Wires Protocol 
 
 **The Techinical aspect behind the inner working of the 3-wire-protocol and why it works well!**
 - it uses electrical energy
 - electrical energy travels as a constant speed no matter the resistance
 - similar to morse code this protocol depends on the duration of the beeps
 
 **Advantages**
 -
 
 electricity travels at a constants speed regardless of the resistance of wire
 
 method of transmission is based on electrical energylapse or the duration of transmission
